This seminar report discusses the work of \textcite{wang2021computing}, which presents an algorithm to efficiently compute an area minimizing surface bounded by a given closed boundary curve.
It applies concepts of differentiable manifolds and geometric measure theory.
Importantly, the mathematical rigor provides insight into restricting the solution space while doing the calculation in a periodic domain.
This allows a significant speedup compared to traditional techniques.
